# Schulte Tables Generator

A Python script that generates Schulte tables in PDF format. Schulte tables are tools used to improve reading speed, peripheral vision, and attention capabilities.

## What are Schulte Tables?

Schulte tables are grid-based exercises where numbers are randomly arranged in a square matrix. The goal is to find numbers in sequential order (1 to 25) as quickly as possible while maintaining focus on the center of the table. Regular practice with Schulte tables can help improve:

- Reading speed
- Peripheral vision
- Concentration
- Visual perception

## Features

## Usage

1. Install the required dependency:
```bash
pip install reportlab

2. Run the script:
```bash
python "Shulte tables.py"
```

The script will generate a PDF file named `schulte_tables.pdf` in the same directory.
